A clone of the [TV Show Premieres](www.revillwebdesign.com/demos/nettuts/angularjs/) angular sample app.
The tutorial for building the angular app can be found on Net Tuts: [Building a Web App From Scratch in AngularJS](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/building-a-web-app-from-scratch-in-angularjs/).

I've probably got something wrong, but overall it works pretty well :)

Before yelling at me for poor performances, remember to switch the ember source to production (HINT: change `<script... ember.js">` to `<script... ember.prod.js">`).
